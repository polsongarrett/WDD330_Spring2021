        <p>
          Functions have methods and properties. <b>call()</b> can set the value of 'this' inside a function to an object that is 
          provided as the first argument.
        </p>
        <!-- HTML displayed as code snippet -->
        <pre class='code'><code>
  function sayHello(){
    return `Hello, my name is ${ this.name }`;  
  }

  const jeff = { name: 'Jeff' };
  const geoff = { name: 'Geoff' };

  sayHello.call(jeff);
  << 'Hello, my name is Jeff'

  sayHello.call(geoff);
  << 'Hello, my name is Geoff'
        </code></pre>
        <!-- HTML displayed as code snippet -->

        <p>
          If the function requires any parameters, they are provided as arguments after the first 'this' argument. 
        </p>
        <!-- HTML displayed as code snippet -->
        <pre class='code'><code>
  function sayHello(greeting='Hello'){
    return `${ greeting }, my name is ${ this.name }`;  
  }

  sayHello.call(jeff, 'How do you do');
  << 'How do you do, my name is Jeff'

  sayHello.call(geoff);
  << 'Hello, my name is Geoff'
        </code></pre>
        <!-- HTML displayed as code snippet -->

        <p>
          You can still use call() with a function that doesn't use "this", but you must use "null" for the first argument. <b>apply()</b> is 
          similar to call() except the argument is provided as an array, even if it's one element.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Memoization</b> is a technique for caching the result of a function so that it can be retrieved later. It saves computing resources
          by reducing the number of times a function must process the same data. JavaScript functions have the <b>cache</b> property for this 
          purpose, and it's accessed as if it were an array using name-value pairs.
        </p>
        <!-- HTML displayed as code snippet -->
        <pre class='code'><code>
  function square(x){
    square.cache = square.cache || {};  
    if (!square.cache[x]) {
        square.cache[x] = x*x;
    }
    return square.cache[x]
  }

  square(3);
  << 9

  square(-11);
  << 121

  square.cache;
  << {"3": 9, "-11": 121}
        </code></pre>

        <p>
          <b>Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE)</b> are functions that are invoked as soon as they are defined. They are useful for 
          creating <b>temporary variables</b> and <b>initialization code</b> that only gets ran once.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Init-Time Branching</b> uses the method of <b>rewriting functions</b> to reduce computing resources. For example, this enables 
          functions to work more effectively in the browser and avoid checking for features every time they’re invoked.
        </p>
        <p><b>Recursive functions</b> call themselves until a condition is met.</p>
        <p><b>Promises</b> are like <b>callbacks</b>, but they can help keep the code more simple when multiple callbacks are used.</p>
        <p>
          <b>Async functions</b> are executed asynchronously. Using the <b>await operator</b> before a function call will make sure no more 
          code is executed until the function call is resolved.
        </p> 
        <!-- HTML displayed as code snippet -->
        <pre class='code'><code>
  async function loadGame(userName) {
    try {
        const user = await login(userName);
        const info = await getPlayerInfo (user.id);  
        // load the game using the returned info
    }
    catch (error){
        throw error;
    }
  }
        </code></pre>
        <!-- HTML displayed as code snippet -->

        <p>Functions can return functions.</p>
        <!-- HTML displayed as code snippet -->
        <pre class='code'><code>
  function greeter(greeting = 'Hello') {
    return function() {
        console.log(greeting);
    }
  }

  const englishGreeter = greeter();
  englishGreeter();
  << Hello

  const frenchGreeter = greeter('Bonjour');
  frenchGreeter();
  << Bonjour

  const germanGreeter = greeter('Guten Tag');  
  germanGreeter();
  << Guten Tag
        </code></pre>

        <p>
          <b>Closures</b> are references to variables only available in the scope of a function, but then "kept alive" and used in another part 
          of the program. This is done by defining a function within another function. The inner function will have access to variables declared
          in the outer function's scope.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another example of a closure is returning the inner function, which grants the outer function access to the inner function's variables.
        </p>
        <p>
          A <b>generator</b> is a function that returns a Generator object used for iteration. It doesn't run any code inside the function itself.
          Every time the iterator’s <b>next()</b> method is called, the code inside the loop is run, and the next value is calculated. The 
          difference between the <b>yield</b> and the return keywords is that by using yield, the state of the value returned is remembered the 
          next time yield is called.
        </p>
        <!-- HTML displayed as code snippet -->
        <pre class='code'><code>
  function* fibonacci(a,b) {
    let [ prev,current ] = [ a,b ];
    while(true) {
        [prev, current] = [current, prev + current];  
        yield current;
    }
  }

  const sequence = fibonacci(1,1);

  sequence.next();
  << 2

  sequence.next();
  << 3

  sequence.next();
  << 5

          <b>Functional programming</b> is a recently-emerging programming paradigm based on <b>pure functions,</b> which adhere to these rules:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            The return value of a pure function should only depend on the values provided as arguments. It doesn't rely on values from somewhere 
            else in the program.
          </li>
          <li>
            A pure function doesn't change any values or data elsewhere in the program. It only makes non-destructive data transformations and 
            returns new values, rather than altering any of the underlying data.
          </li>
          <li>
            Referential transparency. Given the same arguments, a pure function will always return the same result.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>To follow the above rules, pure functions must do the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Have at least one argument; otherwise the return value must depend on something other than the arguments of the function, breaking 
            the first rule.
          </li>
          <li>
            Have a return value; otherwise there’s no point in the function (unless it has changed something else in the program – in which case, 
            it’s broken the 'no side-effects' rule).
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          <b>Higher-order functions</b> are functions that accept another function as an argument, or return another function as a result, 
          or both. Closures are used in high-order functions to create generic functions that can be used to return more specific functions.
        </p>
        <!-- HTML displayed as code snippet -->
        <pre class='code'><code>
  function multiplier(x){
    return function(y){
        return x*y;
    }
  }

  doubler = multiplier(2);

  doubler(10);
  << 20
        </code></pre>
        <!-- HTML displayed as code snippet -->

        <p>
          When a higher-order function returns another function, we can create an anonymous return function and immediately invoke it with a 
          value by using double parentheses. 
        </p>
        <!-- HTML displayed as code snippet -->
        <pre class='code'><code>
  multiplier(3)(5);
  << 15
        </code></pre>

      <p><b>Currying</b> is a process that involves the partial application of functions. A function is curried when not all arguments have 
        been supplied to the function, so it returns another function that retains the arguments already provided, and expects the remaining 
        arguments that were omitted when the original function was called. A final result is only returned once all the expected arguments 
        have eventually been provided.
