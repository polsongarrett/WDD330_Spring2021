          <b>Linting tools</b> can be found on the web for testing your code for errors and sloppy coding practices, although I find
          many of these tools to be too picky and opinionated.
        </p>
        <p>
          Two tools for <b>feature detection</b> include <b>Modernizr,</b> a library, and <b>caniuse.com,</b> which tells you which 
          features are currently supported in different browsers.
        </p>
        <p>
          I use console.log frequently for debugging, but there's also <b>console.trace,</b> which outputs the stack trace to the console.
        </p>
        <p>JavaScript has some built-in <b>Error objects</b> that the browser will throw when different kinds of exceptions occur.</p>
        <p>
          I've always been taught that <b>Test-driven development (TDD)</b> is considered best practice, but sometimes it can get in the 
          way if we always put it first, no matter what.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are many testing frameworks for JavaScript, but this author focuses on using <b>Jest.</b> Though they don't go into it,
          it seems that you first need to install Node.js and npm, then you can install Jest. After installing Jest, here's an example 
          from the book showing how to test some code with Jest:
        </p>
        <!-- HTML displayed as code snippet -->
        <pre class='code'><code>
  function (number) {
    if (number < 0) {
        throw new RangeError("You can't find the square root of negative numbers")  
    }
    return Math.sqrt(number);
  };

  test('square root of 4 is 2', () => {
    expect(squareRoot(4)).toBe(2);
  });
        </code></pre>
        <!-- HTML displayed as code snippet -->
