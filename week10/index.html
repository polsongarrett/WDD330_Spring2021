        <h3>MDN: HTML5 Form Validation API</h3>
        <p>
          HTML5 has built-in form validation that make it easy to perform client-side validation. It's nice, but server-side validation
          should still be performed because a user can still mess with client-side validation.

        <h3>MDN: Fetch API</h3>
        <p>
          JavaScript has the fetch() method, which is the easiest way to fetch resources asynchonously. In many ways, it's easier to use than
          jQuery.ajax.
