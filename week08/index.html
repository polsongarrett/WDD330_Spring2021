      <h3>HTML5 & CSS3 for the Real World: 2nd Edition</h3>

        <h4>Chapter 8</h4>
        <p>
          CSS3 possesses the <b>transform</b> property, which allows us to use <b>transform functions</b> to rotate, translate, 
          scale, and skew elements. This property also lets us change the <b>transform-origin</b> of an element.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Transitions</b> are useful for gradually changing an element over time. This property has control over the start
          and finish of a transition, but not the intermediate states.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Animations</b> have an advantage over transitions in that they can control the intermediate transitions using 
          <b>keyframes.</b>
        </p>

        <p>
          The <b>Canvas API</b> is meant for drawing images with JavaScript by manipulating pixels. It can improve performance by 
          decreasing the amount of downloaded resources such as images and videos. Images can be drawn in 2D and 3D by combining
          WebGL with HTML5 Canvas. We can also add image files, video files, and text to canvas elements.
        </p>        
        <p>
          <b>Standard Vector Graphics (SVG)</b> is a file format for describing vector graphics using XML. <b>Inkscape</b> is useful
          for creating SVGs in order to avoid having to tediously create an image from code. A JavaScript library called 
          <b>Raphaël</b> makes drawing and animating with SVG more convenient.
        </p>
        <p>
          Canvas operates in <b>immediate mode,</b> meaning that once a shape is drawn, it can't be modified again because it does
          not persist as an object. It's also unavailable in the DOM. However, it can be saved as a PNG or JPEG, and it is faster 
          than SVG.
        </p>
        <p>
          SVG operates in <b>retained mode,</b> meaning it is preserved because of the XML file in which it has been defined. SVG
          is accessible in the DOM, and it has tools like Raphaël and Inkscape. However, SVGs can't be manipulated the same way
          as pixels on canvas.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <b>Drag and Drop API</b> lets us define elements as draggable and how they interact with other elements when dragged or
          dropped over them.
